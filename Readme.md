# Bink 2 Encoder
This is the bik2 video encoder
and 3 differents DLLs to use

The "New Engines" is the updated
bink2 api for newer games.

The "Old Engines" is a more outdated
version of the bink2 api for older games.

Support for all games aren't granted.
the "Original" is the retail updated
dll without support of the bik2 generated
by this encoder, you must patch the 
bink2w32 to be able to read the bik2 files
and you can diff that original dll
with the new engines.dll that is already
patched and see watch is patched to
port to a different version of the bink
api.

The "Old Engines" version is tested
only in the Steins;Gate Steam Ver.
